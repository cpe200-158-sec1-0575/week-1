## Read and understand the code, the logic behind it, the limitation of it
* Answer the question 1 - 4 below (you can edit this file directly)
* Change the code such that it will sort from larger to smaller, put the revision of your code below
* Change the code such that there is no flag variable, put the commit number below and answer question 5 


## Revision, put your commit number here
* Sort from larger to smaller: 6fe1fe37773a3f6227d9605da67233e9feb96ff1
* Without flag: 1ce0252e2e6d4d5881fbab4969a6a3923221ee54

## Questions
1. How this code can sort number from smaller to larger
 
Answer: By check variables nearby and swap if right smaller than left.

2. What if two numbers equal, what will happen? 

Answer: End from while loop.

3. How many times at line 24 will be executed (as a function of the size of input) 

Answer: [n,(n-1)^2]

4. Why we need flag variable ? 

Answer: To check variables. If flag is true, it will continue loop and check variables. If flag is false end from while loop.

5. When we remove the flag variable, the code will run faster or slower? in which scenario? 

Answer: The code will run slower.
